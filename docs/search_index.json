["foreword.html", "Foreword 0.1 Why? 0.2 What? 0.3 How?", " Foreword Author: Przemyslaw Biecek (Warsaw University of Technology and University of Warsaw) 0.1 Why? Machine learning has a number of applications. Very often, however, machine learning predictive models are treated as black boxes which can be automatically trained without worrying about the domain in which they are used. This opaqueness rises many risks that are difficult to foresee during the model building process. Such as the model’s declining performance due to the data drift, poor performance on the out-of-domain problems or unfair biased behaviour learned on historical data. The growing list of examples where black boxes fail spectacularly has led to an increased interest in XAI methods. Such methods allow to x-ray black boxes models for more detailed analysis on the local or global level. According to Gartner Hype Cycle for Emerging Technologies in 2019 Explainable AI is on the verge of Innovation trigger and Peak of inflated expectations. It is a technology with a very high potential, which is talked about a lot in the media and which heats up the imagination as strongly as AI. In the literature there are many articles arguing the need to use XAI methods as well as many ideas for new methods from the XAI family. However, it is much more difficult to find examples of successful implementations of XAI methods that have improved the business. Missing elements are case studies of actual use of XAI methods in machine learning problems. Such case studies would allow a better understanding of what is possible today and what is not possible using XAI methods. 0.2 What? This ebook collects examples of the use of different methods from the XAI family for different real-world predictive problems. In the following chapters, we show example applications of different XAI techniques to problems based on real-world public dataset. These examples are called XAI stories and like every good story, each one has a structure. It starts with a description of the predictive problem, goes on to describe the proposed model or models. The models are x-rays using XAI techniques to finish the chapter with a point. 0.3 How? For XAI stories to be credible they need not only a strong predictive model, but also business validation of the proposed modeling and explanation approach. Each group of students got two mentors from McKinsey’s Data Science department. The mentors, together with the students, searched for strengths and weaknesses of XAI applications in specific problems. TODO: write more about this collaboration "],

It can be a house, villa or a flat. Everybody, at some point of life, faces a choice if to buy a house. If so, which one. And why they are so expensive? Topic of real estates is not only the topic you just have to deal with. It can also be very interesting. There are plenty of TV Shows, for instance Property Brothers, of which plot is based on examples of people buying and renovating houses. This particular one is the most famous in the world and has been running already almost a decade. For many people houses are also products to buy and sell with income. Regardless of motives of buy/sell real estate, both sides agree to a price. It is always good to know, how much it is worth, what’s the fair/true value. And, maybe it’s even more important, why the price is like that, what has an influence on it. In this work we want to try to find an answer to both questions with stronger emphasis on the second one. This paper is intended to be a complete use cases how to deal with regression problem for Data Scientists. Let’s start with a couple of questions that will allow us to understand and define the problems The seller does not know how to increase the cost of the apartment so that the investment outlay is lower than the added value (e.g. building a pool will increase the price and renovating the bathroom is not worth it). The seller does not know how much to sell the apartment for (he makes an offer on the portal and does not know if the price is fair). The buyer does not know how much the apartment is worth (as above, whether the price is fair). Commercial problem: Auction services do not have tools to support sellers/buyers. These are just some of the questions we can ask. As a definition of our problem, we have set ourselves a property valuation, and through explanations we will try to get an answer depending on the position we choose. We have divided our work into several stages, below we present a diagram with a step plan. It allowed us to plan our work, and now we will use it to tell you what we did. We started our work with a literature review. Many works show a comparison of hedonistic models (linear regression) and machine learning models. Below there is a plot with comparison of results achieved by models interpretable by design (hedonistic) and black box model (ANN) based on the article @ref(house_prices). We can conclude that we reduce the interpretability to an increase in the quality of model fitting. The next point was data analysis, we work on dataset which contains house sale prices for King County, which includes Seattle. It is include homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015. Data available on kaggle and openml. We have analyzed the data. More link. Data contains 19 house features plus the price and the id columns, along with 21613 observations. id unique ID for each home sold date date of the home sale price price of each home sold bedrooms number of bedrooms bathrooms number of bathrooms, where .5 accounts for a room with a toilet but no shower sqft_living square footage of the apartments interior living space sqft_lot square footage of the land space floors sumber of floors waterfront apartment was overlooking the waterfront or not view how good the view of the property was condition condition of the apartment grade level of construction and design sqft_above the square footage of the interior housing space that is above ground level sqft_basement the square footage of the interior housing space that is below ground level yr_built the year the house was initially built yr_renovated the year of the house’s last renovation zipcode zipcode area lat lattitude long longitude sqft_living15 the square footage of interior housing living space for the nearest 15 neighbors sqft_lot15 the square footage of the land lots of the nearest 15 neighbors We have collected methods to evaluate the performance of the regression model, we decided to use RMSRE (root mean square relative errors), because the difference of 50 thousand on a property worth millions and 50 thousand on a property worth 200 thousand is quite considerable. More about measures link. Based on the literature we decided to test the following models: - fixed effects model - random effects model - Spatial Autoregressive (SAR) model - linear regression - decision tree - random forest - gradient boosting, xgboost Another idea how to enrich our solution was to add external data. The location of the property can significantly affect the price, so we also took into account the distance from public transport and the number of cultural facilities within a kilometre radius. 1.2 Model Place a description of the model(s) here.

This dataset contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel in Portugal, and includes information such as when the booking was made, length of stay, the number of adults, children, babies, the number of available parking spaces, chosen meals, price etc. There are 32 features and 119 390 observations. The booking website has information about these reservation characteristics and building models can help this company in better offer management. The most important information could be the prediction of booking cancelation, the prediction if client comes back to the hotel, the prediction whether client orders additional services (eg. meals), customer segmentation. In this project, we have decided to focus on two first issues. 2.1.1 Hyperparameter optimization 2.1.2 Imbalanced dataset [Put a description of the problem here. indicate the data source.

Booking cancelation The aim of this model is to predict whether guest cancels reservation and explanation of the reasons. The chosen model is XGBoost with RFE (Recursive Feature Elimination). Bayesian optimisation with TPE tuner has been applied in order to improve model performance. Neural Network Intelligence (NNI) package has been chosen for this task, because it provides user-friendly GUI with summary of experiments. List of optimized hyperparameters and search space: max_depth - the maximum depth of tree. n_esimators - the number of trees. learning_rate - boosting learning rate colsample_bytree - subsample ratio of columns when constructing each tree. Figure details paths of hyperparameters values chosen by algorithm. On the right you can see metric (AUC) of model with those parameters. Figure presents AUC for each experiment. It shows a clear trend in model performence so algorithm is choosing better and better hyperparameters. AUC train AUC test image 2.2.2 Model 2.

Booking cancelation 2.3.1.1 dataset image . Figure above shows SHAP values. There are some interesting findings which are intuitive: Clients who canceled some reservations in the past are more likely to cancel another reservation. People who buy refundable option cancel reservations more often than others. A lot of days between reservation time and arrival time increases probability of cancelling booking. People who travel with children are more likely to cancel booking. There are also less intuitive findings: People without any special requests cancel reservetion more often than others. If trip starts at the end of the week there is higher probability that customers change their minds. The bigger number of adults, the highest probability of cancelation. 2.3.1.2 instance The lowest prediction of cancelation probability The highest prediction of cancelation probability 2.3.2 Model 2.

The dataset used is called MEPS (Medical Expenditure Panel Survey) and it is freely accessible at [ref1]. The data comes from large-scale surveys of families, individuals, medical providers and employers from the United States of America. Each observation of the data set contains total expenditures of an individual as well as number of other variables describing his or her demographic and socio-economic status. This allows to create models predicting the expenditure based on other factors. For this reason it is particularly interesting from the point of view of the subject that is financially responsible for the healthcare cost – insurance company, government, healthcare provider or individuals. It is important to mention, that for all of these subjects, accurate model is only a part of the success – the other part are the relations between input parameters and predictions of the model. Having that we can provide an answer not only for how much? but also for why? Hopefully, this can be achieved with available XAI methods. The data analyzed in the following sections was not downloaded directly from MEPS website. Instead, it was obtained through IBM’s AIX360 [ref2]. Therefore it is initially preprocessed – race is restricted to black and white and ethnicity to non-Hispanic, records with special values (negative integers) are removed for some of the variables, variables are initially selected. The dataset provides 18350 observations and it contains variables that describe: demographics (age, gender, marital status), socio-economics (education, income, insurance coverage), self-reported health status (self-evaluation of physical and mental health status), diagnoses (stroke, cancer, heart disease, diabetes), health limitations (cognitive, activity, sensory). Since the distribution of the predicted variable is strongly skewed to the right, it was transformed with logarithm base 3. Typically in such cases, natural logarithm is chosen, but having in mind that impact of input variables on the prediction will be analyzed, the decision was made to use base 3 instead (when we see that some input variable affected the prediction increasing it by one, then we can say that it increased the total expenditures by the factor of three, not factor of Euler number). The following section describes the development of three different models for predicting the transformed total health expenditure of an individual. Once developed, these models are compared in terms of their quality and of them is selected and analyzed using XAI methods. Explanations provided by different methods are discussed. The baseline for this discussion was provided by the authors of IBM’s AIX360 [ref3]. 5.2 Models 5.2.1 Model 1: Linear 5.2.2 Model 2: ANN 5.2.3 Model 3: XGB 5.2.4 Working refs [ref1] https://www.meps.ahrq.gov/mepsweb/ [ref2] https://github.com/IBM/AIX360 [ref3] https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/IBM/AIX360/blob/master/examples/tutorials/MEPS.ipynb#data "],

New technologies, data collection solves the problems not only of large companies but also of ordinary people. Especially if human life is at stake. They say that cancer is the killer of the 21st century. That’s why even small attempts to subdue this problem are important. In our work, we deal with lung cancer. We try to predict the chances of survival of a patient who has had a tumor removal surgery. We try different approaches. 6.2 Model The dataset consists of the following varaibles. Numerical Variable | Unit — | — date_birth | date date_start_treatment | date date_surgery | date tumor_size_x | cm tumor_size_y | cm tumor_size_z | cm years_smoking | years age | years time_to_surgery | years (“today” - date_surgery) Categorical Variable Decription Values sex subject sex male/female histopatological_diagnosis type of cancer Rak płaskonabłonkowy, pleomorficzny, …* symptoms whether symptoms were observed yes/no lung_cancer_in_family whether family member had cancer yes/no stadium_uicc severity of tumor IA1, IA2, IA3, IB, IIA, IIB, IIIA, IIIB, IVA, IVB* alive whether subject is alive yes/no (target variable) About 1/3 af values of varaibles annotated with * was missing. Survivability was registered time_to_surgery years after the procedure, for the majority of the subjects not later than 1 year after the procedure, and at most after 12 years. We have tried out several models as well as different preprocessing strategies. However, all of the approaches yielded similar results differing no more than 0.01 of cross validation acuracy and 0.01 ROC AUC score. These are the models that were utilized: Logistic regression Logistic regression with hyperparameters cross validation Random Forest XGBoost Neural Net - 10 hidden neurons Neural Net - 30 hidden neurons Neural Net - 2 x 10 hidden neurons As we have indentified higle defendent features as well as observed that tumor sizes disturbed the explaination we have employed following preprocessing strategies: encode and normalize encode, remove highly dependent features and normalize encode, introduce tumor volume, discard tumor sizes, remove highly dependent features and normalize Finally we have settled on Neural Net with 10 hidden neurons with following receiver operating curve. 6.3 Explanations We are based on 3 methods of explaining models, mainly Ceteris Paribus as well as Shap and Variable Importance. Of course, it is our goal to understand on what basis our model has found a chance of survival of a given patient. For example, let’s take a patient with the following variable values: - date_start_treatment 2007-03-01 - sex M - histopatological_diagnosis rak niedrobnokomórkowy - years_smoking 35 - lung_cancer_in_family No - symptoms No - stadium_uicc IIIA - age 54 - time_to_surgery 0 - volume 125 Our most recent model indicated that the chances of survival after surgery for such a patient are \\(24\\%.\\) Here we have an explanation of this result by SHAP. According to our intuition, the lack of symptoms increases the chance of survival, quite advanced stage of UICC equal to IIIA reduces these chances. We may also notice that the prognosis is worse because our patient is a man. However, it will be best if we refer to the results of another method - Ceteris Paribus. Here we see 3 variables that show well how a parameter change works for or against the patient. This confirms that women have a better prognosis of survival after surgery, the symptoms of the disease do not herald the best, and also the younger we are, the better we are able to cope with convalescence. Here too, the model shows that if our patient’s cancer was classified as much lighter, his chances would increase. Let’s take a look at another method for the whole data set - Variable Importance. The most important one seems to be the variable that says when the patient started treatment. The second most important is the UICC stage. Interestingly, the period of time the patient smoked cigarettes does not affect the outcome too much. But using model explanations not only helps to explain the result of the prediction, it can also give a hint how to improve our model. When we built the model on all variables, the explanations allowed us to find correlations. Let’s compare the CeterisParibus results for the full model and the deleted dependent variables. In the picture above you can see that the influence of two correlated variables was distributed between them, but after leaving only one of these variables, the influence accumulated on it (picture below). At this stage we can already conclude that the techniques of model explanations are not only useful at the end of our journey. They can give us tips on how to transform data or which variables should be deleted. 6.4 Summary and conclusions XAI methods legitimised employed approach of pruning the dataset. XAI methods yielded explainations consistent with biological intuintion, what builds up trust in the model. As variety of modelling and preprocessing approaches resulted in similar predicitive performance we conclude there is not much more to squeeze out of the dataset. "],

It involves making a lot of decisions in order to maximize profits and cut down costs - finding the tradeoff is not a straight-forward task. Here comes Machine Learning and uplift models that can help in optimizing marketing costs. People often ask whether it makes sense to address marketing campaigns to all company’s customers. From one point of view by sending an offer we think the probability that the customer will buy our product is higher - in fact it is not always the cases (the matter will be described in details later). On the other hand, making large-scale campaign is costly. Therefore it would be good to know what is the return of investment. Above we presented the common sense arguments but how science addresses a question: “Is it true that by sending the marketing offer we only extend the chance for the customer to buy our product and therefore extend our profit?”. The issue was already investigated (Verbeke and Bravo 2017) and it was pointed out that customers of any company can be divided into 4 groups 7.1. FIGURE 7.1: Customer types taking into consideration their response to treatment The image matrix was created based on the customer decision to buy a product depending on the fact that they were addressed by marketing campaign or not. The action used for trigggering in customer the particular behaviour is called treatment. In the 4 groups we distinghuish 7.1 : the customers that irrespective of the fact that they experienced treatment or now that are going to buy a product (these are called “sure things”) the customers that irrespective of the fact that they experienced treatment or now that are NOT going to buy a product (“lost causes”) the customers that without being exposed to marketing campaing would NOT buy a product (“persuadables”) the customers that without being exposed to marketing campaing would buy a product but in case thay receive a marketing offer they resign (“sleeping dogs”) It can be than observed that in case of “lost causes” and “sure things” sending a marketing offer makes no impact therefore it doesn’t make sense to spend money on targeting these customers. As the company we should however pay more attention to the groups “persuadables” and “sleeping dogs”. In case of the first bearing the costs of marketing campaign will bring benefit. In case of the latter we not only spend money on targeting them but as the result we will also discourage them from buying the product therefore we as a company loose two times. The case of sleeping dogs can seem irrealistic, therefore we present an example. Let’s imagine there is a customer that subscriped our paid newsletter. He forgot that he pays each month fixed fee. He would continue paying unless a company sends him a discount offer. At this moment the customer realises that he doesn;t need and offer and unsubscripes. By understading the structure of the company’s customers, it can target its offer more effectively. 7.1.1 Approaches towards uplift modeling In (Akshay Kumar 2018) it was pointed out that the problem of deciding whether it is profitable to send an offer to particular customer can be tackled from two different perspectives: predictive response modelling (it is classical classification task where model assigns probability to each of the classes) and uplift modelling (where the “incremental” probability of purchase is modelled). The latter is more interesting but at the same time more challenging. Uplift modeling is a technique that helps to determine probability gain that the customer by getting the marketing materials will buy a product. The field is relatievely new. The two most commmon approaches are (Lee 2018): Two Model In this method there are build two classifiers. The one is trained on observations that received treatment (model_T1) and the second is trained on observations that didn’t receive a treatment (model_T0). Later the uplift for particular observations is calculated. If the observation experienced treatment then it is an input to the model_T1 and the probability that the customer will buy a product is calculated. Later the if condition is investigated meaning what would happen if the customer didn’t receive a treatment. In Ssuch case the treatment indicator in observation’s feature is changed to “zero”. Such modified record is an input to model_T0 that predicts the probability that such customer will buy a product. The uplift is calculated as difference between output of the model_T1 and model_T0. The higher the difference, the more profitable is addressing marketing campaign to particular customer. One Model The one model approach is similar conceptually to the Two model approach with such a difference that instead of building two classifiers only one is used. Therefore every observation is an input to the model that generates prediction. Later the indicator in the treatment column is changed into the negation and such vector is used as input to the model that once again output probability that the customer buy a product. The uplift is the difference of the two predicted probabilities. [przydałoby się stworzyć jakąś prostą grafikę tutaj] As the uplift modeling is an emenrging field there isn’t a list of good practices in terms of what classifier is better to use. In (Zaniewicz and Jaroszewicz 2013), the autors investigated application of SVM. But due to the fact that SVM requires precise, long lasting finetuning we decided to use xgboost (the architecture of our solution is described in details in section Model). 7.2 Dataset There is a scarcity of well-documented datasets dedicated to uplift modeling. Therefore the autors of (Rzepakowski and Jaroszewicz 2012) proposed to artificially modify available datasets in order to extract information about treatment. As the purpose of this story is to investigate XAI techniques in the domain of uplift modeling we decided to use real life dataset. We chose Kevin Hillstrom’s dataset from E-Mail Analytics And Data Mining Challenge (Hillstrom 2008).The dataset consists of 64000 records reflecting customers that last purchased within 12 months. As a treatment an e-mail campaign was addressed: 1/3 of customers were randomly chosen to receive an e-mail campaign featuring Mens merchandise 1/3 were randomly chosen to receive an e-mail campaign featuring Womens merchandise. 1/3 were randomly chosen to not receive an e-mail campaign (“control group”) As an expected behaviour the following actions were determined: * visit the company’s website within 2 weeks after sending to the customers a marketing campaign * purchase a product from the website within 2 weeks after sending to the customers a marketing campaign In the challenge the task was to determine whether the Mens or Womens e-mail campaign was successful. In our task we reformulated the task and we want to answer the question whether any e-mail campaign was profitable for the company. The features about customers in the dataset are specified in fig @ref(fig:kevin_dataset): (#fig:kevin_dataset)Customer features in the dataset There is also information about customer activity in the two weeks following delivery of the e-mail campaign (these can be interpreted as labels): Visit: 1/0 indicator, 1 = Customer visited website in the following two weeks. Conversion: 1/0 indicator, 1 = Customer purchased merchandise in the following two weeks. Spend: Actual dollars spent in the following two weeks. [zwiększę potem czcionkę na grafice] 7.2.1 Feature engineering It is largely imbalanced - there is only about 15% of positive cases in column Visit and x% in column Conversion. In such situation we decided to use column Visit as a label. As the number of column is small we decided to use one-hot encoding for transforming categorical variables instead of target encoding. 7.3 Model [wymaga dopracowania] There is not many packages dedicated to uplift modeling in python. We investigated the two: pylift (“Pylift Package - Documentation,” n.d.) and pyuplift. The latter enables usage of 4 types of models - one of those is Two Model approach. In pylift package there is the TransformedOutcome class that generate predictions. However, the model itself is not well described and uses XGBRegressor unserneath that is not intuitive. Fortunately the package offer also the class UpliftEval that allow uplift metric visualization. In the scene, we decided to create our own classifier (as in the One-Model approach) and use UpliftEval class from pylift model for metric evaluation. As the classifier we used fine-tuned XGBoost. In the figure below we show the cumulative gain chart for train and test sets. (#fig:uplift_train)Cumulative gain chart - train set (#fig:uplift_test)Cumulative gain chart - test set It can be seen that our model is better than random choice but much worse than practical/theoretical maximum possible. It is also worse than the case without sleeping dogs. It is worth emphesising that our model didn’t experience overfitting as its quality on train and test sets are similar. [napisać gdzieś że miara accuracy jest tu niewłaściwa i poprzeć to dowodem liczbowym] 7.4 Explanations [wymaga dopracowania] The model is already created and the metric show that it brings additional value.Here comes the question whether the model is reliable, does it make the decision based on the features that are important form expert knowledge perspective. Such judgement can be done based on results of XAI tools. We decided to investigate model interpretability from the perspective of the 4 customer groups @(fig:4groups). Therefore we chose one representative customer from each group and analyse the model on instance-level. 7.4.1 Shapley values [narazie to tylko zarys trzeba to lepiej opisać] We employed package shap [cite] to compute Shapley values. We decided to take benefit of its characteristic of linearity. Meaning that the difference of shapley values on the model prediction on the case of treatment=1 and shapley values on the model prediction on the case of treatment=0 should be equal to the shapley values computed directly on uplift model. [figures] Conclusions (Lundberg and Lee 2017) 7.4.2 Feature importance [napisać że uogólniamy Shapley values] Here, show how XAI techniques can be used to solve the problem. Will dataset specific or instance specific techniques help more? Will XAI be useful before (pre), during (in) or after (post) modeling? What is interesting to learn from the XAI analysis? 7.5 Summary and conclusions Here add the most important conclusions related to the XAI analysis. What did you learn?
